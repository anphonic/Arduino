# Arduino
With the rollout of the enshitification of Arduino by Qualcomm, who is planning the theft of everything anyone has ever written and or uploaded using Arduino, regardless of whether or not they are a minor, this stuff is all gone. I know this is just me, but I do hope almost everyone who knows what is being threatened by Qualcomm does the same.

Time to put the ESP32's I have sitting around to use I suppose.
