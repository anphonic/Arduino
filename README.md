Goodbye Arduino, it was nice when learning, education, and open source was real.

With the rollout of the enshitification of Arduino by Qualcomm, who is planning the IP theft of everything anyone has ever written and/or uploaded related to Arduino, regardless of whether or not they are a minor, this stuff is all gone. I know this is just me, but I do hope almost everyone who knows what is being threatened by Qualcomm does the same.  

Time to put the ESP32's I have sitting around to use I suppose.

## [Arduino Terms & Conditions](https://www.arduino.cc/en/terms-conditions)  
Arduino’s official Terms and Conditions outline the rules for using its platform, including account creation, premium services, arbitration clauses for U.S. users, and restrictions for minors. Importantly, the terms grant Arduino broad rights over user-generated content, impose strict compliance with export laws, and include mandatory arbitration for disputes. These provisions establish a legal framework that prioritizes corporate control and compliance, raising concerns about how user contributions and data may be leveraged under Qualcomm’s ownership.

## [TechSpot – Community Reaction](https://www.techspot.com/news/110375-qualcomm-rewrote-arduino-tos-community-not-taking-well.html)  
TechSpot reports that Qualcomm’s rewrite of Arduino’s Terms of Service has sparked backlash among hobbyists and makers. The changes grant Arduino perpetual rights over user content and raise fears about intellectual property capture. The article emphasizes that the community sees this as a betrayal of Arduino’s open-source ethos, with many users considering alternatives like ESP32 and Raspberry Pi.

## [Ars Technica – Hobbyist Concerns](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/arduinos-new-terms-of-service-worries-hobbyists-ahead-of-qualcomm-acquisition/)  
Ars Technica highlights widespread anxiety among hobbyists following the new Terms of Service, which coincide with Qualcomm’s acquisition. The article notes that the perpetual licensing of user content and vague data policies undermine trust in Arduino’s open-source foundation. Makers worry that their projects, including educational work, could be absorbed into Qualcomm’s ecosystem without meaningful consent.

## [ByteIota – Community Erupts](https://byteiota.com/qualcomm-rewrote-arduinos-tos-community-erupts/)  
ByteIota details how the maker community erupted after Qualcomm rewrote Arduino’s Terms of Service just 30 days post-acquisition. The new rules grant an irrevocable, perpetual license over all user uploads, enable AI monitoring, and integrate data—including from minors—into Qualcomm’s global systems. Adafruit and other leaders condemned the move, calling it a death blow to Arduino’s community trust. Many developers are already migrating to ESP32 and Raspberry Pi Pico, which offer mature alternatives.

## [Jeff Geerling – What It Means for Makers](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/qualcomms-buying-arduino-%E2%80%93-what-it-means-makers)  
Jeff Geerling reflects on Qualcomm’s acquisition of Arduino, noting both the legacy of Arduino as a gateway for millions of makers and the uncertainty of its future. He discusses the new Uno Q board, a hybrid SBC-microcontroller powered by Qualcomm’s chips, and questions whether Qualcomm will support Linux and maintain Arduino’s educational focus. While acknowledging potential hardware innovation, Geerling expresses skepticism about Qualcomm’s stewardship of the brand and community.
